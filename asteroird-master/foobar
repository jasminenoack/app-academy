Distance

To find the "distance" between two points, the formula is:

// this is math, not JavaScript
Dist([x_1, y_1], [x_2, y_2]) = sqrt((x_1 - x_2) ** 2 + (y_1 - y_2) ** 2)
Norm

A vector has a norm, a.k.a. magnitude or length. The norm of a velocity vector is a speed. If obj.vel = [3, 4] (3 horizontal pixels and 4 vertical pixels per unit time) then the overall speed is 5 pixels per unit time. You can easily calculate the norm of a vector using your distance function:

Norm([x_1, y_1]) = Dist([0, 0], [x_1, y_1])
